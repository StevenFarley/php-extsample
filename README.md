extsample
---------

Contains practical examples of PHP extension writing. Things like handling arrays, returning values,
creating classes and methods, class constants etc.

This extension is not meant to be a full-blown documentation for writing PHP extensions but hopefully
provides useful snippets and patterns to get started.

Development
-----------

I'll be adding random examples from time to time. If you need a specific example, just open an issue.
Pull requests are welcome as well.
